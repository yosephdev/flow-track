# SQLAlchemy ORM

## Learning Outcomes
In this project, we will learn:
- How to create a task management application using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
- Implementing HTML-based user interfaces to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Styling the user interfaces using the Materialize CSS framework for an enhanced user experience.

## Project Overview
The Flow Track task manager application will include the following features:
- Display a summary of tasks on the home page, including task name, due date, urgency, category, and description.
- Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- Users can perform CRUD operations for task categories as well.
- The application will be fully responsive, utilizing Materialize framework grid-based classes.

## Project Structure
The project will be structured as follows:
- **run.py**: Main Flask application file containing route definitions and CRUD operations.
- **templates/**: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering user interfaces.
- **static/**: Directory for static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **taskmanager/**: Python package containing the application's models, routes, and tests.
